                  <p> We all have experiences in life when we felt like we were in "the darkness."  My story for each topic is found above. I will continue to share my stories as well as yours to hopefully 
                      inspire and encourage you to begin to see the beauty in the darkness more often but also to appreciate the times of dark because it makes the light even better.
          
                      I believe we find strength in sharing. Please share your own story of "The Beauty in the Darkness."  Pick a topic to file it under and have your story possibly spotlighted on the blog.
                      Please change names and locations to keep it anonomous! Also, enter your favorite image song and author that represents your version of Beauty in the Darkness!!
